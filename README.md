# Warehouse
This project, developed using TIA Portal and simulated in Factory I/O, implements an automated warehouse handling system. Incoming packages arrive on a conveyor belt, where they are picked up by a robotic arm and placed onto an industrial scale. A monitoring screen displays the measured weight in real time, allowing the operator to choose—through an intuitive graphical interface—where the package should be stored within the warehouse.

The same graphical command interface can also be used to manage the unloading process, enabling operators to request the removal of specific packages and coordinate their dispatch.

The combination of TIA Portal automation logic, Factory I/O visualization, and user-friendly control functions creates a cohesive system for efficient, flexible, and interactive warehouse management.
